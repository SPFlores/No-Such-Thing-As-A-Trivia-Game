# No Such Thing As A Trivia Game

If you've ever listened to "No Such Thing As A Fish," a podcast hosted by 4 researchers from QI in Britain, then you'll probably do really well on this quiz! All the facts are pulled from different episodes of what is (in my opinion) one of the best podcasts out there. 

## How it works

A player starts the quiz by pressing a button which randomizes the order of the questions, and then the answer choices are also randomized, so no two games will be exactly alike!

Once the player chooses an answer to the question, a page is displayed informing them if they got the answer right or wrong and some more information about the topic. After 9 seconds (I spent a while tweaking that and I realize it's a little long, but it's the best amount I have found for it) the game automatically advances to the next question, no input needed.

At the end of the game, the number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions is tallied and the player is asked to play again and some information on the podcast that this is based off of (honestly, I cannot recommend this podcast enough, it's so good).

For the basics of my timer, I useed [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31106189/create-a-simple-10-second-countdown) as a starting point. I tweaked it a bit to better suit my needs, but this was super helpful for making my way ot exactly what I wanted.

[This article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6274339/how-can-i-shuffle-an-array) helped me figure out how to randomize/shuffle my question array and also my answer choices so I could have a more unique game experience every time.

Again, all the praise to W3 schools for constantly helping me muddle my way through. Especially [this](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_animate_buttons.asp) button tutorial for adding >> to my button. I love the look of it. I also pulled some info from there about dialing in my button shadows.

[This](http://sstut.com/javascript/convert-hours-minutes-seconds-to-milliseconds.php) was super helpful in helping me convert all my milliseconds/seconds/minutes for the end page.

Last thing I really used was [this](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_No_Such_Thing_as_a_Fish_episodes.html) article with a list of (almost) all the facts from the different shows.

## Thank yous

Lastly last, thank you majorly to Rey G, Patrick B, M Flo, and Vicki F, for listening to me constantly talk about the podcast and forcing them to play this game. Couldn't have done it without their support.
